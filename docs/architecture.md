# Architecture

project_validator learns as much as it can about a project into a database of facts, answers questions about the
project from those facts, and judges the answers against a policy. Knowing how to read a build system, a tool or a CI
configuration is kept apart from deciding what a well-run project needs.

```
 project files ──► extractors ──► facts ──► questions ──► answers ──► policy ──► check results
                   (parse)        (database)  (query)     (machine-     (judge)
                                                          readable)
```

This document describes the target design and the migration to it. Sections marked **Today** describe the code as it
is; the rest is the design new work moves towards.

## Why

Today each language profile (`project_validator/ecosystems/<name>.py`) supplies a typed rule to each practice: the
regular expressions that recognise its tools, where to look for them, and what counts as passing. Detection and
requirements are mixed in one object, so:

- Adding a language touched about 25 shared files: the registry, test tables, the README's per-check rows, and the
  snapshot of every other fixture (the skip message listed every language). Two profiles developed side by side
  conflicted in all of them.
- Knowledge that is not about one language had to live in one: CMake belongs to the C/C++ profile, although it also
  builds Fortran, CUDA and Swift; gcov, llvm-cov, lizard and the sanitizers are copied or special-cased per profile;
  the CI layer parses Cargo, SwiftPM and Xcode build types itself.
- A profile that cannot meet a requirement (Go has no branch coverage, nothing measures F# function length) needs a
  special case, in the profile and in the tests.

## Layers

### Extractors

An extractor reads one kind of thing it understands and records facts. Extractors are the plugin surface: adding a
language, a build system, a tool or a CI provider means adding extractors, and nothing else changes.

| Kind | Reads | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| CI provider | CI configuration | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI: jobs, their OS, toolchains and environment, and the commands each step runs |
| Command expansion | what a command runs in turn | npm, Deno and Composer scripts, Rake tasks, Make recipes, CMake presets, Maven lifecycle phases, pre-commit hooks |
| Build system | build files | CMake, Meson, Bazel, Cargo, Gradle, Maven, MSBuild, SwiftPM, Xcode: the languages built, settings and their scope, build types, build trees and outputs, the test runner |
| Toolchain | compiler and interpreter settings | GCC, Clang, MSVC, gfortran, rustc, swiftc, CPython: warning, hardening, sanitizer and coverage instrumentation flags |
| Tool | a tool's invocation and configuration | gcovr, coverage.py, eslint, clang-tidy, lizard, osv-scanner, SwiftLint: what it measures or enforces, and for which files |
| Language | source files | which languages a project uses, by suffix and by content |
| Repository | the files themselves | committed artifacts, ignore rules, licences, security policy, large files |

Extractors run in stages, and each one declares the fact types it reads and writes: files and recognition, then build
systems and CI, then command expansion, then tool runs and settings, then the joins that decide what is in effect.

A component lives with the only language that uses it (Cargo, Composer, Bundler) until a second language needs it;
then a small refactor moves it into a shared module before the second language is added.

### Facts

A fact is a typed, immutable record. Every fact has:

- **a subject**: what was found, e.g. "gcovr runs with branch metrics", "`-Werror` is set", "job `linux-gcc13`
  exists".
- **a scope**: the languages, files or targets it covers, and the CI jobs (OS, toolchain, build configuration) it
  is in effect for. Scope is what lets one fact serve several languages: `add_compile_options(-Werror)` in CMake
  covers every language CMake compiles with a GCC-style compiler, Fortran included; `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` covers C++
  only.
- **provenance**: how it was found, for results and their details, e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `test` →
  step 4 → `npm test` → `package.json` `scripts.test` → `vitest --coverage`.
- **confidence**: read from structured data, or matched by a heuristic.

A setting is in effect only when something CI runs reads it: an eslint configuration that enables
`max-lines-per-function` counts once eslint runs in a CI job, directly or through a script CI runs. Settings and
invocations are joined to decide what is in effect.

What could not be read is recorded too: a matrix computed by an expression, a reusable workflow in another
repository, a command no extractor understands. Absence of a fact is "no" only where nothing is unknown.

Commands are split into arguments, and extractors claim them by program and subcommand, rather than searching
command lines for a flag anywhere on the line.

Facts are Python dataclasses held in memory (`project_validator.facts.Facts`), queried by kind and field, by tool
setting and by the file a tool reads (see step 3½). They are exported as JSON by `--facts`.

### Questions

A question is a query over the facts that answers one thing about the project, per language: "what coverage is
reported for Python?", "are warnings errors for C++?", "which OS/toolchain/configuration combinations does CI build?"
Questions are the stable, machine-readable interface; checks and other consumers depend on them, never on
extractors.

An answer is one of:

- **yes**, with the facts that show it;
- **no**;
- **unknown**, with the reason (an unreadable matrix, a remote workflow);
- **impossible**: no known tool can provide it for the language. Go's tools measure statements, not branches; Swift's
  measure regions; nothing measures F# function length.

"Impossible" follows from what the known tools can do: tools declare their capability by facts that do not name our
languages (the file suffixes lizard parses, the lockfiles osv-scanner reads, the languages CodeQL analyses), so a new
language picks up every tool that already supports it. The same capabilities give the suggestions in results: "tools
known to report branch coverage for Rust: cargo-llvm-cov, grcov".

### Policy

A policy maps answers to statuses. For coverage: branch coverage is required (or the finest granularity possible for
the language, when branch coverage is impossible), and path or MC/DC coverage is a bonus. Checks become thin: a check
names its question and its policy and formats the result. `--strict` and `--warnings-as-errors` adjust the policy,
not the questions. The policy is built in to begin with; it is a separate layer so that it can be made configurable
later without touching extraction.

An **unknown** answer is a gap in the validator's tooling (configuration it cannot read, such as a CI provider it
only scans heuristically, or a matrix computed by an expression), not a finding about the project. So it is an
`ERROR`, which fails the run and names what was not read, unless the user passes `--allow-unknown`; then the answer
is judged by what could be read, as a no.

### Worked example: branch coverage in this repository

1. The GitHub Actions extractor records the job `coverage` and its command
   `["coverage", "run", "--branch", "-m", "unittest"]`.
2. The coverage.py extractor claims `coverage run` and records that coverage.py runs in that job, measuring lines
   and branches, for Python.
3. Without `--branch`, the same extractor reads the configuration coverage.py would read (`.coveragerc`, else the
   first of `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini` and `pyproject.toml` with coverage settings) for `branch = true`: the setting
   joins the run, and counts for nothing without one.
4. The coverage question answers for Python: lines yes, branches yes, paths impossible.
5. The coverage policy requires branches: PASS, with no path coverage suggestion, because none is possible.

## Invariants

Tests keep these from step 1 of the migration on:

- Adding a language, build system, tool or CI provider adds modules and fixtures and edits no shared list: built-in
  profiles and checks are discovered, and tests and documentation derive their expectations from the registry.
- A result names only the project's own languages; nothing in one fixture's results changes when an unrelated
  language is added.
- Checks do not name languages or tools.

## Migration

Each step is one pull request with every gate green. The snapshots (`tests/snapshots`) must be reproduced exactly,
except where a step deliberately changes results and says so.

1. **Discovery and derived expectations.** Built-in profiles are discovered like checks; each profile's fixtures,
   test layouts (`tests/layouts/<name>.py`) and documentation page (`docs/ecosystems/<name>.md`) are named after its
   module; tests derive their language lists from the registry; the README describes each check without per-language
   detail; the skip message stops listing every language.
2. **Facts and the CI command graph**, in three parts:
   1. The fact store (`project_validator/facts`) and the CI facts: each provider extracts its jobs (one per matrix
      combination), the commands each one runs (split by `project_validator/facts/shell.py`) with the step's
      condition, the actions it uses with their inputs, and what it could not read. `--facts` prints them.
   2. Command expansion (`project_validator/facts/expansion.py`): a `CommandExpander` says what a command runs in
      turn, and the commands found are expanded again, each with `via`, the chain that led to it. Expanders live
      with what they know and are found, not listed: package.json scripts and Deno tasks in the JavaScript profile,
      Composer scripts in the PHP profile, Make and CMake's custom targets (`cmake --build --target`) in
      `project_validator/build_systems`, pre-commit in `project_validator/tools`. Rake tasks and Maven lifecycle
      phases follow when their profiles move onto facts; presets and phases are settings rather than commands.
   3. The jobs the checks judge are built from the facts. A GitHub step or job whose condition is false for a
      combination yields no facts, and known expressions are evaluated (`project_validator/ci/github_expressions.py`).
      A job's evidence is what it runs: commands (with the variables its environment defines), image, environment,
      and action inputs whose values are known; step names and conditions are not evidence. Each build system reads
      the build types from its own commands (`BuildSystem.build_types`). Compilers and toolchain versions are still
      matched in that evidence, matrix values first (an action input that is switched off is not evidence);
      reading them structurally is the toolchain step (5).
3. **Coverage end to end.** Coverage extractors for every supported language, the coverage question and its policy;
   the `coverage` check moves to them and the `CoverageTools` rules are deleted.
   - A coverage tool records the languages it measures and each granularity it can measure (line, statement,
     region, branch, path) with how to ask for it, and claims the commands that run it by program and subcommand
     (since 3¾ an ordinary `Tool` with a `coverage` aspect). A claimed command is a run, joined with the
     configuration that command reads (`pytest` with its `addopts` and coverage.py's settings, `phpunit`
     with its XML, `dotnet test` with the MSBuild settings and `.runsettings`, `xcodebuild test` with the scheme,
     `cmake` configuring with the CMake files): a setting alone, which nothing CI runs reads, counts for nothing.
   - Launchers are command expanders that yield `Launched` commands: `bundle exec rake` runs `rake`, `npx c8` runs
     `c8`, `python -m coverage` runs `coverage`, `uv run pytest` runs `pytest`.
   - Components (command expanders and coverage tools) are found by `project_validator/components.py` in the
     shared build systems and tools and in the profiles (and their modules), never listed.
   - The coverage question (`project_validator/questions/coverage.py`) answers per language and granularity; the
     policy (`project_validator/policy/coverage.py`) requires branch coverage, or the finest granularity a known tool
     can measure, and reports path coverage as a bonus. An unknown answer is an error, naming what was not read
     (see Policy).
   - `--answers` prints the answers. C and C++ coverage tools stay in the C/C++ profile (`c_cpp/coverage.py`) until
     step 5 shares them with Fortran.

   **3½. Foundations: structure and settings as facts, and the query layer.** Step 3 showed that without shared
   layers each question would read files and join settings in its own extractor. Before the remaining practices
   move:
   - **Structure facts** (`project_validator/facts/structure.py`): every source file with its language
     (`SourceFile`), every build file with the languages it builds (`BuildFile`), what content probes found
     (`ContentLanguages`), and the suffixes no ecosystem accounts for. Vendored code (a `vendor`/`third_party`-style
     directory, a minified `*.min.js`) is recorded but makes no language the project's. The project map (`--map`)
     is a view over these facts, with the vendored files listed.
   - **Setting facts** (`project_validator/facts/settings.py`): a `SettingsReader` component reads one tool's
     settings from the files it reads by default and from the configuration files CI commands name
     (`--rcfile`, `-c`, `--settings`). Each file read is a `ConfigurationFile` fact; each setting a `Setting`
     (tool, dotted key, value, origin), flagged `heuristic` when matched in code (a Jest config, a Gradle script).
     Format helpers cover TOML, INI, JSON, XML and `key = value` files. A file that does not parse is an `Unknown`
     scoped to its tool, so it makes unknown only the answers that depend on that tool.
   - **Queries** (`Facts`): indexed by kind, with `where(kind, **fields)`, `settings(tool, paths=…)`,
     `setting(tool, key, paths=…)`, `configured(tool, paths)` (the first file with the tool's settings) and
     `first_file(reader, paths)` (the first file that exists).
   - **Extraction stages** (`Context.facts`): structure, then CI and command expansion, then settings (which
     need the commands that name configuration files), then the tools those commands run.
   - **Coverage, rebuilt on them**: coverage tools are pure functions of a command and the facts; none reads a
     file. Each declares the settings tools it `reads`, which scopes the unknowns that matter to its answers.
   - **Questions are components** (`Question` in `project_validator/questions`), found like the others, so
     `--answers` lists whatever questions exist.

   **3¾. One tool model, and units.** So that no practice builds its own copy of the machinery, and so that
   monorepos and mixed-language projects are judged where their code is:
   - **One tool model** (`project_validator/facts/tools.py`). A `Tool` records the languages it handles and, per
     *aspect* it can provide (`coverage` now; `lint`, `format`, `analysis`, `audit`, `type-check` as practices
     move), the levels it can provide and how to ask for each. It claims commands (`claims(command, facts)`) and
     reads only facts. A claimed command is a `ToolRun`: job, tool, languages, the aspects and levels that run
     provides, the settings files it read, and its scope (its working directory). Each question reads the runs of
     its aspect; a tool that serves several practices (ruff formats and lints) is one tool with several aspects.
     Coverage is spelled with `coverage_tool` and `measured` (`project_validator/facts/coverage.py`), which only
     fill in the `coverage` aspect.
   - **One way a command runs another.** Wrappers (`sudo`, `env CC=clang`, `nice`, `emcmake`, `xvfb-run`,
     `ccache`; `project_validator/tools/wrappers.py`) are launchers like `bundle exec` and `npx`: the command they
     run is a `Launched` command of its own, with the variables they set. `resolved` only substitutes variables.
   - **One way to read a command line** (`project_validator/facts/arguments.py`): `program`, `option_values`,
     `has_option`, `short_flags`, `positional`.
   - **Units** (`Unit` facts, `project_validator/facts/structure.py`). A unit is the outermost directory with a
     build system's files (a CMake project's subdirectories and a Maven project's modules belong to it), or a
     member of a workspace a build file declares (`BuildSystem.members`: npm, yarn and bun workspaces, Cargo and
     uv workspaces, go.work). A unit's languages are those of its own sources (outside the units below it), and
     what its build files build unless they only declare a workspace; sources outside every unit belong to the
     root unit. `--map` lists the units.
   - **Roles.** Every source file and unit has a role, told by the directories it is in (above any source root
     such as `src` or `lib`, so `com/example/App.java` is product code): `product`, `test` (tests and test-fixture
     projects), `example`, `docs`, `tooling`, `benchmark`, or `vendored` (below a vendor directory anywhere, or a
     minified bundle). Auxiliary code adds no language to the unit it is in, and only product units are held to
     coverage: a C++ library's Python docs scripts do not need Python coverage, and a test-fixture project needs
     none of its own.
   - **Unknowns say what they may hide** (`Unknown.hides`): whole `jobs`, `commands` of a job, a job's `matrix`
     values, or `settings` of named tools. A question counts only the unknowns that may hide what it asks about:
     an unreadable matrix does not make coverage unknown, and a broken `phpunit.xml` does not make a Python
     project's coverage unknown.
   - **Reading more of what CI runs.** A quoted string may span lines, and quoted or escaped operator characters
     are text (`awk -F '|'`, `find -exec … ';'`). `cd` changes where the rest of a script runs. Commands in a
     directory the project does not contain (another checkout, a build tree CI generates, `cd /tmp`) are not
     expanded and cover none of the project's code. A job that calls a reusable workflow of the same repository
     runs that workflow's jobs; a workflow that runs only `on: workflow_call` runs only where it is called.
     Workspace-wide script runs (`pnpm -r`, `--filter`, `npm --workspaces`, `turbo run`, `lerna run`,
     `nx run-many`) run each workspace package's script (npm, yarn and bun workspaces, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
   - **Questions answer per language per unit.** A run covers the units at or below its working directory, and the
     unit that directory belongs to (the deepest unit containing it), so a run from the root covers every unit, a
     run in `src/` covers the root unit, and a run in `packages/a` covers only that package (since step 4; before,
     it covered the root unit above it too).
     A project with one unit is judged as before. In a monorepo, findings name the unit (`packages/b: no branch
     coverage …`); in a mixed-language project each language is judged in the units that have it (a C++ project
     with Python bindings in `python/` needs Python coverage there).
4. **The remaining practices**, one at a time, each deleting its rule type from `rules.py`. Each becomes settings
   readers, an aspect of the shared `Tool` model, a question answered per language per unit, and a policy. What
   every practice needs is shared: `project_validator/questions/__init__.py` has the units of a language, the runs
   of an aspect in a unit and the unknowns that matter to some tools (`per_unit`, `runs_of`, `unknowns_for`), and
   `project_validator/judging.py` makes a question and a policy into a check (`answered_check`), labelling results
   by language and unit.

   **4a. Formatting** (`code-formatting`; the `Formatter` rule is deleted).
   - **The `format` aspect** (`project_validator/facts/formatting.py`) has two levels: `check`, a run that fails on
     unformatted code, and `apply`, one that rewrites it. Applying it enforces it where a change fails CI or is kept:
     a pre-commit hook (pre-commit fails when a hook changes a file), a job that runs `git diff --exit-code` or
     `--quiet`, or commits (`git commit`, `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action`). A run that only prints the
     formatted code is not a formatter run. `flagged(prefixes, checks=…, applies=…)` spells most formatters' claims
     (`flagged(("ruff", "format"), checks=("--check", "--diff"))`); `either` combines claims.
   - **Where a tool's behaviour is defined** (`Tool.definitions`, a `Definition` per aspect): the files that define
     its style, found as the files a settings reader read (`defined_by(files=…)`: a `.clang-format`, whatever it
     holds; `file_reader` records such files without reading settings) or the files holding a tool's settings
     (`defined_by(settings=…)`: `[tool.ruff]` in pyproject.toml), and whether the tool has a default of its own. A
     definition applies to the units at or below its directory, and to the unit it is in. Linters and analyzers will
     use the same for their rules.
   - **Actions run commands** (`Action`, in `project_validator/facts/expansion.py`): a reusable CI step that runs a
     known command (`psf/black` runs `black --check --diff .`) is expanded into that command, so tools only ever
     claim commands.
   - **Reading more of what CI runs**: commands inside a command substitution (`test -z "$(gofmt -l .)"`) run before
     the command they are part of, and `xargs` launches its command. A local composite action (`uses:
     ./.github/actions/build` or `$/…`) runs its steps in the calling job, with its inputs in place (a missing one
     is unknown; a JavaScript or Docker action runs its own code). An action's `working-directory` input is where
     its command runs. A job that shows a diff for a later step to fail on (`DIFF=$(git diff)`) is taken to enforce
     what its formatter applied, as a heuristic run.
   - **Settings outside vendored code**: a settings reader reads the files it finds by name only outside vendored
     directories (a `deps/jemalloc/.clang-format` is not the project's); a file a command names is read wherever
     it is. Roles moved to `project_validator/facts/roles.py`, shared by structure and settings.
   - **The formatting question** answers per language per unit: whether CI enforces the formatting (yes, no,
     unknown, or impossible when no known tool formats the language), with which tools, which only rewrite files,
     which files define the style, and which tools CI runs whose style needs a definition the project lacks. Each
     formatter handles only its own languages: ktlint formats Kotlin, not Java; Fantomas F#, not C#.
   - **The policy** passes enforcement with a defined style (a file, or the tool's own), fails a style that is not
     defined, a run that only rewrites files, or no run; warns when a style is defined but CI does not enforce it;
     an unknown answer is an error unless `--allow-unknown`. Hints come from the tools (`can`), not from profiles.
   - **Plugins add components** (`project_validator/components.py`, `add_plugin_modules`): a plugin module's tools,
     settings readers, expanders and actions are found like the built-in ones, and a check made of a question
     applies to the languages its tools now handle (`Check.languages_from`).
   **4b. Static analysis and type checking** (`static-analysis`, `type-checking`; the `Analyzer`, `StaticAnalysis`
   and `TypeChecking` rules are deleted).
   - **One answer for every tool-based practice** (`project_validator/questions/tooling.py`): `ToolAnswer` holds,
     for one aspect of one language in one unit, the known tools (how each provides each level, whether it needs a
     definition, whether it is required alongside the others), the tools CI runs with the levels they provide and
     the settings files they read, the files that define each, and the unknowns. A practice's question is
     `aspect_answers(aspect, level)`; formatting moved onto it. Policies live in `project_validator/policy/`, one
     module per practice, with the wording helpers they share.
   - **Aspects**: `analysis` (one level, `checks`: an analyzer's `Definition` is where its checks are chosen; clang-tidy
     and golangci-lint need one) and `type-check` (`checks`, and `strict` as a bonus), spelled by `analyzer`,
     `analysed`, `type_checker` and `type_checked` (`project_validator/facts/analysis.py`). `Tool.required` marks an
     analyzer that must run alongside the others (clang-tidy and cppcheck). `combined` makes one tool of the same
     program's aspects (RuboCop and Standard format and lint; biome formats and lints; PHPStan and Psalm analyse and
     type check).
   - **Build-wired analyzers**: CMake's `CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`/`_CPPCHECK` run their analyzer in a build CI
     configures; JVM analyzers run by their goals and tasks or by the plugins a build's verification brings in, Error
     Prone by every compiling build; .NET analyzer packages (`PackageReference`, now read from MSBuild files) by every
     build; SwiftLint's build tool plugin by a package build. `go run <package>@<version>` and `go tool` launch the
     program the package names.
   - **pre-commit.ci** (`project_validator/ci/pre_commit_ci.py`) is a CI provider: a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with
     a `ci:` section (`CiProvider.recognises`) runs its hooks, but those in `ci.skip` (pre-commit's `SKIP`). Its job
     never `builds` (`CiJob.builds`), so it is no platform or build configuration. A pre-commit hook counts only where
     CI runs it; before, any hook counted.
   - **Each tool for its own languages**: Error Prone, PMD and Checkstyle analyse Java, detekt Kotlin; .NET analyzer
     packages C#, FSharpLint F#.
   - Components may be defined as module-level tuples (one analyzer per NuGet package), and settings readers may name
     files by the end of their path (`sorbet/config`). `defined_by(named=…)` counts a file by existing (an empty
     `ty.toml`).
   - Profiles that grew past one module became packages (`python`, `javascript`, `jvm`), each with an `analysis`
     module.
   - **Reading more of what CI runs** (from the corpus): tox environments (`tox -e`/`-f`/`run`/`p`, the env list,
     factor-conditional commands, braces, `tox.ini`/`tox.toml`/`[tool.tox]`; a factor from a variable matches every
     section it may be); the project's shell scripts (`bash ci/lint.sh`, `./ci/lint.sh`); GitLab local `include:`
     files, `extends:` and `!reference` (YAML values with local tags are `Tagged`; other includes are unknowns that
     hide jobs); PowerShell scripts (a step's `shell: pwsh`, or a Windows runner's default) split with PowerShell's
     escape character; and a GitHub job whose matrix is an expression runs its steps with the matrix values unknown
     (before, its steps were lost).
   - **Auxiliary code does not speak for a unit**: a run only in an example's or the docs' directory (tsc in
     `examples/app`) covers no unit of another role, and an auxiliary directory's configuration defines no tool of
     the unit it is in. tsc reads the configuration it uses (`-p`, or `tsconfig.json` where it runs, and the local
     ones it extends). Findings list at most three files, and how many more.

   **4c. Tests** (`tests-run`; the `TestSuite` rule is deleted).
   - **The `test` aspect** (`project_validator/facts/testing.py`), one level, `runs`. A runner's `Definition` is where
     the tests it runs are: the `TestFile` facts of the kinds it runs, or what a build system registers (CTest's
     `add_test` after `enable_testing()`, Meson's `test()`, read as settings). A `TestFiles` component says what a
     language's test file is (a path, and what it contains); test files are a structure stage. `Definition.describe`
     says what defines a tool for findings, and `from_test_units` lets a separate test project's tests
     (`tests/App.Tests`) count for every unit.
   - **Probes** (`Probe`) run the project's own tools when asked (`--build`): the C/C++ profile's builds the project
     and counts what ctest lists (`BuiltTests`); a build that cannot run is an unknown that hides ctest's tests.
     `ToolAnswer.unknown_definitions` keeps the unknowns that may hide a definition apart from those that may hide a
     run, so that "no tests found" is said only when that is known.
   - `coverage run -m <module>` launches the module, as `python -m` does; a sourced script (`. ci/test.sh`) runs its
     commands.
   - A directory a variable names (`cd $BUILD_DIR`) is unknown rather than outside the project: nothing is expanded
     there, but a tool run there covers the whole project, heuristically (most often it is the project's build tree).
     Before, such runs covered nothing.
   - Roles: a unit's own directory name tells its role first, below a source root too (`internal/tools`, a Go tools
     module, is tooling); fuzz and stress tests, and directories named `tests-…`, are test code. So a crate of fuzz
     targets or a tools module is not held to having tests of its own.

   **4d. Dependency audit** (`dependency-audit`; the `DependencyAudit` rule and `MULTI_ECOSYSTEM_AUDITS` are deleted).
   - **The `audit` aspect** (`project_validator/facts/audit.py`), one level, `runs`. Auditors that serve every ecosystem
     (osv-scanner, trivy of the file system, snyk) are made by `multi_ecosystem_audits(languages)` in
     `project_validator/tools/audits.py`; each profile makes them its own, for its languages, so a language whose
     ecosystem has nothing to audit (C/C++) is not judged. Their actions are shared.
   - Audits that a build performs are claims on the build: a restore with `NuGetAuditMode` `all`, a Composer install
     with `roave/security-advisories` required, dependency-check bound to Maven's verification.
   - `starts(*prefixes)` and `when(matches, run)` (`project_validator/facts/tools.py`) spell the commonest claim: a
     program, and the subcommands after it.

   **4e. Security scanning** (`security-scanning`; the `SecurityLints` rule is deleted).
   - **The `security` aspect** (`project_validator/facts/security.py`), one level, `scans`. CodeQL, GitLab SAST and
     semgrep are made by `multi_language_scanners(languages)` (`project_validator/tools/scanners.py`) for each
     profile's languages (CodeQL not for PHP, which it does not analyse). A language's security lints are claims on
     the tool that runs them with the settings that turn its security rules on: ruff with `S`, golangci-lint with
     gosec, eslint with eslint-plugin-security, Psalm's taint analysis, SpotBugs with Find Security Bugs, PMD with its
     security rules, a .NET build with the Security category turned up, a cargo build with `unsafe_code` forbidden.
     A setting alone, which nothing CI runs reads, no longer counts.
   - **GitLab's known templates** (`Security/SAST`, `Dependency-Scanning`, `Secret-Detection`, ...) are jobs that
     build nothing and run the template as a marker command (`gitlab-template <name>`), which the scanners claim;
     other templates stay unknowns that hide jobs.
   - Settings readers may name files in hidden directories (`.cargo/config.toml`); those directories are read.
   - The same result for every ecosystem is said once (`combined`), rather than labelled ecosystem by ecosystem.

   **4f. Function length** (`function-limits`; the `FunctionLimits` rule is deleted).
   - **The `function-length` aspect** (`project_validator/facts/limits.py`): a run `measures` function length, and
     `limits` it when it fails on a function longer than a limit. lizard is a shared tool
     (`function_length_limiters(languages)` in `project_validator/tools/limits.py`), made by each profile for the
     languages lizard measures; it limits when told a length (`-L`, `--length`, `-T length=`).
   - **A linter's rule** is a `limiter`: the linter's own claim (when it runs) and a `Rule` read from its settings,
     on by default unless they turn it off (RuboCop's Metrics/MethodLength, SwiftLint's function_body_length,
     detekt's LongMethod) or only once they turn it on (clang-tidy's readability-function-size with a threshold,
     golangci-lint's funlen, eslint's max-lines-per-function, Checkstyle's MethodLength, PHPMD's
     ExcessiveMethodLength). Their settings are read structurally where the format allows it (`.clang-tidy`,
     `.rubocop.yml`, `.swiftlint.yml`, detekt, Checkstyle and PHPMD XML); eslint's, which is code, is matched.
   - lizard named only in CMake files no longer counts: it is judged by what CI runs, like every other tool, until
     CMake custom targets are read (step 5).

   **4g. Dependency management** (`dependency-management`; the `DependencyManagement` rule is deleted).
   - **Facts** (`project_validator/facts/dependencies.py`): settings readers of each package manager's manifests and
     lockfiles record a manifest that `Declared` dependencies, a lockfile (or setting) that `Locked` them, and whether
     a package is an `Application` or a `Library`. A `PackageManager` says when its lock is asked for (always, for
     applications, or never), how to lock, which CI commands verify dependencies (`mvn --strict-checksums`), and
     which files are its vendored output.
   - **`Untracked`**, a structural fact: a file git does not track, so an ignored lockfile locks nothing.
   - The question is answered per language and unit: a manifest belongs to the unit that owns it (not the docs' or
     tooling's), a lockfile locks its directory and those below it (a workspace's lock locks its members). A manifest
     that does not parse makes the answer unknown.

   **4h. Build outputs** (`vcs-ignore`, `committed-artifacts`; the `BuildOutputs` rule is deleted).
   - **`BuildOutput` components** (`project_validator/facts/outputs.py`): what a language's builds (or one build
     system's: SwiftPM's `.build`, Maven's `target`) write. A language's outputs are those of the build systems the
     project uses, or its own when none has one; every build system in use has its outputs ignored.
   - **The repository stage** (`project_validator/facts/repository.py`) reads git's tracked files once: the files it
     does not track (`Untracked`) and the tracked files that are a build output (`CommittedOutput`), which the
     settings readers cannot see, as build trees are not walked.
   - **Ignore entries** are facts read from `.gitignore`, `.hgignore`, `.bzrignore` and Fossil's `ignore-glob`
     (`project_validator/tools/version_control.py`).

   **4i. License** (`license`; the `DeclaredLicense` rule is deleted).
   - **Facts** (`project_validator/facts/licenses.py`): each `LicenseFile` with the licenses it holds (read by
     `project_validator/tools/licenses.py`), and each manifest's `DeclaredLicense`, read by the profiles.
   - The project's license is that of the license files at its root (and REUSE's `LICENSES/`). A product manifest
     is compared with the license files nearest to it, in its directory or the nearest above it, so a monorepo member
     may hold its own; the manifests of the docs, examples, tooling and tests are not compared.

5. **Shared build systems, toolchains and tools**: CMake, Meson, MSBuild, Gradle and Xcode, and the GCC, Clang and
   MSVC flag knowledge, leave the C/C++ profile; llvm-cov, gcov and osv-scanner become shared tools.
   - A build file sets options and settings for some builds only: those of one compiler (`if(MSVC)`), platform,
     configuration (`$<CONFIG:Debug>`) or language, or behind something only configuring decides (an option, a
     compiler check). A `Condition` (`project_validator/facts/conditions.py`) is a set of builds, kept as a reduced,
     shared multi-valued decision diagram over those dimensions and the requirements not understood, so that the
     many branches of a real build file stay exact and cheap; `CompilerOption` and `BuildSetting` facts
     (`project_validator/facts/build.py`) each hold one disjunct of it, as `Applies`.
   - CMake is read without running it (`project_validator/build_systems/cmake`): its files are parsed by the
     language's grammar and evaluated as configuring would evaluate them, from each top-level CMakeLists.txt through
     `include()`, `add_subdirectory()` and the project's own functions and macros, with variables in their scopes
     and every branch followed in the builds it holds in. Presets add their cache variables, in the builds configured
     with them. A file nothing reaches is evaluated as if included, a function nothing calls as if called, each
     under that requirement. CTest registrations, CPM and FetchContent, and the analyzers a build runs
     (`CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY`) are read from the same evaluation; `cmake --build` expands to the commands of the
     custom targets it builds.
   - Meson is read the same way (`project_validator/build_systems/meson`): meson.build files are parsed and evaluated
     from each top-level one through `subdir()`, every `if` branch followed in the builds it holds in; the compiler
     (`cc.get_id()`, `cc.get_argument_syntax()`), the host system and the build type are understood, other options
     and compiler checks (`cc.has_argument()`, `cc.get_supported_arguments()`) are requirements. `default_options`,
     a target's `override_options` and meson.options defaults are `BuildSetting`s; project, global and target
     arguments are `CompilerOption`s; `test()` registers tests; `meson compile <target>` (or `ninja <target>`) runs a
     run target's command. `Dimension` (`project_validator/facts/conditions.py`) is how each build system names a
     dimension's values (CMake's `GNU`, Meson's `gcc`).
   - Each build system turns its own settings into the compiler options they pass (`implied_options`): CMake's
     `COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR` passes GCC `-Werror` and MSVC `/WX`, Meson's `warning_level` (1 by default) and
     `werror` theirs. The C and C++ compilers' flag vocabulary is a shared tool (`project_validator/tools/toolchains.py`).
   - What CI builds with is a fact: a `Job` holds each CI job's OS, compilers (or the runner's default), toolchains,
     build configurations and ecosystems, extracted once after the jobs' commands are expanded.
   - Practices that ask for settings (`compiler-warnings`, `warnings-as-errors`) are `Practice` components
     (`project_validator/facts/practices.py`) in the profile that knows the language: the `Requirement`s it asks
     for, all of them or any one, each met by a CI command or reusable step (matched in it, with its variables and
     inputs), a run of a tool, the profile's settings files (matched heuristically by a `requirement_reader` until
     they are read structurally), or facts such as the `CompilerOption`s that apply to a compiler. C and C++ are judged
     for each compiler CI builds with, by the flags that apply to it; every language by its own requirements (Java
     and Kotlin, C# and F#, apart). The answers are per language (`project_validator/questions/practices.py`).
     `hardening` is a practice too: GCC's, Clang's and MSVC's hardening flags for C and C++ (GCC's `-fhardened`
     meets them all, for GCC only), release overflow checks for Rust, position-independent executables for Go (a
     project that builds no Go program is skipped), and for Swift a practice that forbids: compiling the runtime
     safety checks away (`-Ounchecked`).
   - `cxx-extensions` is a practice met by any one setting: CMake's `CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS` off for the whole
     build (preferred) or a target, or Meson's standard `cpp_std`; C and C++ each by their own.
   - What varies between a language's CI jobs besides the OS is a `ToolchainAxis` component
     (`project_validator/facts/axes.py`): compilers for C and C++, toolchain versions for the others; a compiled
     language's axis asks `ci-build-types` of it. `platform-matrix` and `ci-build-types` answer from the `Job` facts
     (`project_validator/questions/platforms.py`). With that, `rules.py` and the per-practice dispatch (`practice`,
     `Ecosystem.rules`, `rule_for`) are gone: every check is a question and its policy.
6. **Profiles shrink** to language recognition and the language's own tools: what they still hold that several
   ecosystems share moves to the shared build systems and tools.
7. **Proof**: add Fortran using only extractors and a recognition module.

`--facts` and `--answers` expose the database and the answers.
