"""Questions: queries over the fact database, each answering one thing about the project per language, in each unit

Answers are the stable, machine-readable interface (`--answers`); checks judge them by a policy and never read
extractors (see docs/architecture.md). What every question needs (the units of a language, the runs of an aspect in
a unit, the unknowns that matter to some tools) is here, once.
