"""Tools and their runs: every practice's tools (coverage, linters, formatters, analyzers, auditors) in one model.

A `Tool` records its whole upstream capability: the languages it handles, and for each aspect of a project it can
provide (`coverage`, later `lint`, `format`, `audit`), the levels it can provide with how to ask for each. It claims
the commands that run it, and reads nothing but the facts: a claimed command becomes a `ToolRun` fact with the
aspects that run provides, joined with the settings it read (see `project_validator.facts.settings`). A setting
counts only when CI runs the tool that reads it. Questions read the runs of an aspect; none has its own tool type.
